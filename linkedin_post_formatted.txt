ðŸ”´ What if we could predict pitcher injuries before they happen?

I just built a Bayesian survival model that identifies high-risk pitchers with 60% accuracy - and discovered why most injury prediction models fail.

The journey was wild:
â€¢ Started with a BROKEN model (C-index: 0.361 - worse than guessing!)
â€¢ Found a critical bug in how everyone calculates concordance for AFT models
â€¢ Fixed it â†’ jumped to 0.607 accuracy
â€¢ Built a production dashboard now predicting 2025 injury risks

Key insights:
âœ… Simple linear models beat fancy neural networks
âœ… Performance stats aren't enough - we need biomechanical data
âœ… Bayesian methods give us uncertainty (crucial for $100M roster decisions)
âœ… 49% of "Very High Risk" pitchers got injured vs 29% "Low Risk"

The most fascinating part? The model revealed that veteran status and games played matter MORE than ERA or strikeouts for injury risk. Your ace with great stats might be a ticking time bomb.

Real-world impact: Teams lose $500M+ annually to pitcher injuries. Even 60% accuracy saves millions and wins.

Full technical deep-dive on my blog - including the code, failed experiments, and why biomechanical data would 10x this model:

HOW TO POST ON LINKEDIN:
========================

1. COPY the text above

2. GO TO LinkedIn and click "Start a post"

3. PASTE the text (emojis and bullets will work automatically)

4. ADD YOUR IMAGE:
   - Click the image icon (or drag and drop)
   - Upload: pitcher_injury_thumbnail.png
   - This will appear as a preview card below your post

5. FORMATTING TIPS FOR LINKEDIN:
   â€¢ Use line breaks (Enter) for spacing - LinkedIn preserves these
   â€¢ Emojis work great for visual appeal

   â€¢ NO bold/italic with markdown - use CAPS for emphasis instead
   â€¢ Links become clickable automatically

6. OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
   â€¢ Tag relevant people (@connections who like baseball/data)
   â€¢ Add more hashtags if needed
   â€¢ Consider posting at peak times (Tue-Thu, 8-10am or 5-6pm)

7. AFTER POSTING:
   â€¢ Comment on your own post with additional insights
   â€¢ Share in relevant LinkedIn groups
   â€¢ Cross-post to Twitter with a shorter version
